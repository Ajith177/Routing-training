      <p className='para-3'>At the start of the call, you'll hear the reason for the call 
        and that the call is from Google. You can expect the call to come from 
        an automated system or, in some cases, a manual operator.
        Appointment bookings and checking restaurant wait time with 
        Google Assistant are only available in the United States, and will call from +1-650-203-0000.
        Google may also call or text to 
        confirm your business details, including temporary closure 
        or limited services due to COVID-19, so they are reflected accurately 
        when people are looking for them on Google Search and Maps.
